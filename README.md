# OLX Clone Project

Welcome to the repository! This project is an OLX-inspired web application that I built using **ReactJS** as the frontend framework and **Firebase** as the backend service. The main goal of this project was to enhance my skills in ReactJS and gain a deeper understanding of Firebase for real-time data handling and backend services.

## Key Technologies Used:
- **ReactJS**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Firebase**: Used for authentication, database, and storage functionalities.
- **Formik**: Simplified form handling in React.
- **YUP**: Schema-based form validation for improved reliability and user experience.
- **React Router**: For implementing seamless client-side routing in the application.

## Why I Built This Project:
I developed this OLX Clone to:
- Boost my proficiency in ReactJS by working on a real-world application.
- Understand Firebaseâ€™s backend services like authentication, Firestore, and storage.
- Gain hands-on experience using Formik for form management and YUP for form validation.
- Explore **React Router** for handling multiple routes and page navigation.

## Features:
- **User Authentication**: Sign up, sign in, and sign out functionality using Firebase Authentication.
- **Real-Time Data**: CRUD operations for product listings using Firebase Firestore.
- **Form Handling**: Easy form management with Formik.
- **Validation**: Robust form validation using YUP.
- **Routing**: Dynamic routing using **React Router** for smooth navigation between pages.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile users.
